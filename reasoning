gather subgraphs from various services, run them through a rules
engine, and make http requests with the conclusions.

E.g. 'when drew's phone is near the house, and someone is awake,
unlock the door when the door's motion sensor is activated'

When do we gather? The services should be able to trigger us, perhaps
with PSHB, that their graph has changed.
